[FrenchTouch.tech](http://www.frenchtouch.tech) is about discussing the specifics of the `french-touch`. 

This blog started after reading multiple news article which mentionned the `french-touch`[1](https://medium.com/cuepoint/deeper-than-daft-punk-a-love-letter-to-the-french-touch-f956508153b0#.gkrenc72m),[2](http://www.nytimes.com/1964/04/05/caribbeans-french-touch.html?_r=0),[3](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/db51a45e-4472-11e0-931d-00144feab49a.html),... but never explained what it was referrring to.

It is also about discussing how the french culture and ways of doing things can bring a much needed diversity in a world falling at lighting speed under the influence of english speaking media and artists.

While many aspects of the french-touch are of relevance, this blog will mostly focus on the technology aspects of it. But beware, since technology touches almost any aspects of our lives this blog will adressing a pretty broad range of topics.

Obviously, other old world reaching cultures like [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_China), [Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire),[Nigeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nok_culture), ... or new upcoming ones like [Brazil](http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0034-73292010000300002&script=sci_arttext) could also bring another point of view but we will leave this to people knowing those culture well enough to talk about them.
