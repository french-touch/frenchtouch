# `French-Touch` over time
When was the expression first used?
Who coined the expression first? Has the meaning changed over time?

Many of those questions are near impossible to answer. However there is an interesting tool from Google which will let us plot the frequency with which this expression was used over time.

<iframe name="ngram_chart" src="https://books.google.com/ngrams/interactive_chart?content=french+touch&case_insensitive=on&year_start=1800&year_end=2008&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t4%3B%2Cfrench%20touch%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3BFrench%20touch%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BFrench%20Touch%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BFRENCH%20TOUCH%3B%2Cc0" width=900 height=500 marginwidth=0 marginheight=0 hspace=0 vspace=0 frameborder=0 scrolling=no></iframe>

While the data from the n-grams need to be dealt with [carefully](http://www.wired.com/2015/10/pitfalls-of-studying-language-with-google-ngram/). Let's have a look at different dates:

* 1830: hard to say.
* 1949: most likely the release of the novel.
* 1990: this peak coincides with the `french touch` house music.
