## wikipedia content growth is slowing

It looks like Wikipedia content creation has now reached decreasing growth rate and will saturate in 2025. Have we reached the peak of p2p knowledge sharing ?

## alternative open source knowledge sharing 

* wiki university: (add here content growth)
* khan academy: but they stopped investing on non-video content: exercises and even removed from the public domain the knowledge graph.
* youtube: great content but not curated and too long (need 2x and caption to make it digestable)
* tiktok: short & crisp, wide range, not curated, no learning paths

## what could the future of encyclopedism?

The ideal system will combine peer-learning (42), wikipedia and kahn academy ... and breaking up the videos to atomic information level (tik tok).
