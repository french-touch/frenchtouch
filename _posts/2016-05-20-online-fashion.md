# Lost `French-Touch` for fashion with online retail?

A recent [article](http://tech.eu/brief/european-fashion-tech-funding/?utm_content=buffer46058&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer) made me wonder if the French fashion had lost its touch given the prevalance of english and german online fashion brands (respectively Asos and Zalando). 

While the dominant `haute-couture` is not yet impacted by the online sales (wait ... did I hear someone mention [Amazon](http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/mar/09/amazing-fashion-will-amazon-as-a-fashion-site-ever-take-off) )?

Recent news however suggest french fashion is now playing catch-up with 6 deals so far which is higher than other countries.

The question for which we will try to give an answer in the coming months and years: will this be enough?
