Improvements of the distribution of information have brought significant improvements in human s life and had had repercussions on political systems. 

Press for instance allowed the appearance of mass produced books with it's spread of ideas and communication between government and citizens. This has permitted the rise of democracies. 

We are seeing now new innovations that are making possible the creation of new ways of managing a state. 

First, language specifications like the catalogs programming language allow to define q certain part of the law corpus as a set of rules that make it easy to compute ( without having a human reading the whole set to find the applicable career).
Ethereum allow for the creation of decentralized contracts. This has 2 advantages: 
- no required human to validate the contract (and saving the fees)
- automatic check of the contract application.

Public websites are much better at sending information both in terms of timing (no constraints on timing) and of format: files or even visualizations can be sent in order to improve citizen readability and understanding.

Combination of structured law text and public websites could allow for rapids creation and application of laws. For example when COVID was raging, laws were depending on the number of cases that day, so it was very difficulty to track. This could substitute the current law diffusion system which is based on long daily files full of new laws and addendi. 

Online referendi make it possible to spread information and get citizen or use opinion instantly. For example, teams from Microsoft let attendees send live questions and vote already submitted questions. This gives priority to the interest of the majority in real time and automatically.

We also should take into account the context we are living in. China and Russia are pushing an ideological war against democracies which they seemed inferior to their systems. This is also pushing democracies to improve and adopt innovations to keep being relevant systems.
