# Corporate life and `suspension of disbelief`

> What can we learn from `suspension of disbelief`, `PowerPoint Karaoke` and `Conway's law` for a more productive corporate/private life.

## The `PowerPoint Karaoke` of business

> The only rule in a `Powerpoint Karaoke` is for the show person to never retreat from a clain and own all the statments made.

* Similarly the business world be it in big business or in startup has turned more into being convincing when presenting than value creation.
* The underlying principle in action is that actors (the ones presenting) or spectators are entering a state of `Suspension of Disbelief` where consitency across all presentations trumps verification.
* Which leaves no place for constructive criticism (except still in deep technical organisation) especially when it comes to verify business assumptions.

## Differences

* In business another rule is to stick to the branch or industry `Buzzword Bingo` semantics.
* Startup will also oscillate between obsession and failure whereas impro theater will focus on the flow and public feedback.
* Camel start-up stand-out when it comes to business (corporate or unicorn startups) as focus on customer income is key

## Moving to the `Aikido of Conway`

> Instead of fighting the corporate business, identify its strength and use them for your work/life balance.

* Given that any organisation will deliver products and service matching its internal organisation as per the `Conway's Law`
* Align internal structure with customer need to ensure delivery are aligned with needs.
* One must not seek to fight it but like in aikido unify this energy in a `Aikido of Conway` best examplifies lately by `RenDanHeYi (人单合一)` from Hayer's CEO (Zhang Ruimin - 张瑞敏). See below in transcripts key insights from Zhang Ruimin.
