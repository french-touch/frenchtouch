# Business and suspension of disbelief

Business has moved from entrepreneurship to `PowerPoint Karaoke`. 

## The `PowerPoint Karaoke` of business

> The only rule in a `Powerpoint Karaoke` is for the show person to never retreat from a clain and own all the statments made.

* Similarly the business world be it in big business or in startup has turned more into being convincing when presenting than value creation.
* The underlying principle in action is that actors (the ones presenting) or spectators are entering a state of `Suspension of Disbelief` where consitency across all presentations trumps verification.
* Which leaves no place for constructive criticism (except still in deep technical organisation) especially when it comes to verify business assumptions.

## Differences

* However some difference remain between business and impro-theater. For instance in business it is key to stick to the branch or industry `Buzzword Bingo` semantics.
* Another difference between startup and big business and the `oscillation between obsession and failure` often seen and needed in startups.
* 

## Moving to the `Aikido of Conway`

* Given that any organisation will deliver products and service matching its internal organisation as per the `Conway's Law`
* One must not seek to fight it but like in aikido unify this energy in a `Aikido of Conway` best examplifies lately by `RenDanHeYi (人单合一)` from Hayer's CEO (Zhang Ruimin - 张瑞敏).
* Align internal structure with customer need to ensure delivery are aligned with needs.
