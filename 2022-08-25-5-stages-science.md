# 5 stages of science

> From stone age to AI

## The 5 stages

1. observation
2. equation
3. simulation
4. modeling
5. emulation

## Observations

For millenia, humans observed the world and built artifacts to help predictions of seasons.

## Equations

![Newton's manuscript - Philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica](https://www.finebooksmagazine.com/sites/default/files/styles/gallery_item/public/media-images/2021-06/verso-newton-principia.jpg?itok=2SjKnnSV)

Equations became slowly the way science described the world as a denser way to convey information from brain to brain.

## Simulations

With computers, it became possible to solve differential equations based on boundary conditions and weather forecasting for the following hours became possible.

## Modeling

As computer got more powerful, simulation models based on physics first principle like protein folding and binding became possible.

## Emulation

AI trained on dataset, generates implicit models which are much faster at processing than first principal based modelling. 
[For instance a team at Columbia University created an AI network which can make physics prediction but thoes are not using energy or mass or any usual concepts from classical physics](https://scitechdaily.com/artificial-intelligence-discovers-alternative-physics/)
