   <h1>2023-07-14</h1>
<p>It would be helpful to have an improved voice recorder on the iPhone that allows for easy storage and collaboration of audio files. The idea is to utilize Google Drive or a similar platform to store and share the audios, and then use tools like Whisper and collab to convert the audio into text and make summaries. The end goal is to eventually publish the workflow and interesting ideas, while keeping the API key secure.  The conversation revolves around the idea of using audio flow, pipes, and segmentation for content generation. The goal is to automate the flow and generate content in various formats such as podcasts and blogs. The speaker highlights the advantage of being aware and mentions the use of agents to perform specific tasks for content creation.  The speaker mentions that tasks are divided among agents who execute them automatically, resulting in a lack of human intervention. They argue that this process only involves the recycling of existing content, leading to a lack of novelty and interesting ideas. However, they agree with the idea of automating mundane content generation to focus on exchanging new ideas and discussing them in an enjoyable manner.  Discussing detailed points that are boring can be time-consuming, but it's better to have engaging conversations that generate interesting ideas. By summarizing conversations, we can highlight important concepts and turn them into impactful tweets or blog posts. It is essential for humans to select and share the ideas they find intriguing, providing sources for further exploration.  The idea is to automate the process of generating summaries from conversations, as well as creating tweets and blog entries based on those summaries. By doing so, the goal is to attract an audience and monetize it. However, the speaker finds this approach a bit clichÃ© and raises the question of how to make it more interesting.  There are relevant things that people can identify with and that are far from what is generally thought. One example is the idea that the new way to vote is not through actual votes, but through consumer choices. This concept should be further developed. Another topic discussed is the presence of big, competitive companies, especially in the tech sector, where time investment is crucial, not just financial contribution.  It is important to spend time rather than just give money, especially on websites that align with our interests. Google and Facebook may not have the same interests as us, so it is necessary to detach ourselves from using their services. While Apple has less dependence on advertising, their ecosystem is still corrupt and they artificially limit their products like the iPad. Although other brands may not have the same performance, Apple's limitations are a drawback.  Apple is praised for their excellent hardware, but they intentionally limit their products. Previously, people would try to jailbreak their devices and install different operating systems, but now it's more difficult and fewer people are attempting it. This decline in interest and support is seen as a defeat by Apple, dividing those who prioritize short-term interests and those who strive for a better future.  moralistic position, but it is concerning that some individuals prioritize maximizing their pleasure now and leave it up to their children to navigate their own fulfillment later. This approach revolves around limiting pleasures for sustainability purposes but neglects the importance of maintaining a positive atmosphere and losing sight of ethics. The Anglo-Saxon system differs from this mindset as it is more pragmatic and less idealistic, emphasizing individualism and the present rather than considering others' needs.  The French approach to finding an ideal system is ineffective because it is difficult to achieve perfection. Unlike the French, Americans prioritize immediate progress rather than searching for a theoretical solution. French people are idealistic and believe in the importance of equality, whereas Americans are more focused on winning, regardless of the consequences.  Americans prioritize their own financial success, even if it causes significant problems for others. A book on the Asian concept of yin and yang emphasizes the need for balance and constant change, challenging the Western belief in absolute truth. The world is in a constant state of fluctuation, and it is crucial to recognize that truth is not fixed but dependent on different situations and circumstances.  Something being true or false today will remain valid for eternity. There are situations that require oscillations between multiple states, and instability arises from these oscillations. To return to what is important, it is necessary to be able to oscillate between making a decision to move forward today and keeping an eye on the horizon to avoid becoming a predator that burns in front of everyone.  The focus on maximizing profit has led to a disregard for the importance of making sacrifices. The speaker believes that the discussion on climate change is a distraction, as it is too late to reverse the damage and the real issue lies in finding a solution for waste management. The speaker suggests that the reason for the lack of action is the fear of losing wealth, as making efforts to reduce waste would allow others to profit at one's expense.  Some extremists argue that pursuing environmental protection leads to personal poverty and living in a polluted environment as society continues to pollute. This results in a loss of freedom to afford a cleaner or larger house, limiting the enjoyment of personal space. The crux of the issue lies in a society prioritizing short-term profit rather than seeking long-term solutions, such as ending the dumping of waste in others' spaces. Additionally, it is concerning to witness inequality, as the wealthy minority, who possess a considerable portion of the world's wealth, continue to pollute despite advocating for reduced consumption among the general population.  The immense wealth and environmental pollution caused by the top 0.01% of the population is unjustifiable. The likes of Jack Bezos and Elon Musk contribute significantly to pollution while getting richer, while the poorest suffer the consequences. It is unnecessary to rely on high-tech gadgets like iPads when simpler devices like Raspberry Pi can perform the same functions. The concept of Apple's economy, built on outdated hardware and excessive computing power, is illogical and detrimental to both the environment and society.  large screen, so it's frustrating that I can't find a suitable tablet for my car's central console.  In the discussion, it is mentioned that old Microsoft Surface devices can be used for running GPS applications and can even have Linux installed on them. The idea of refurbishing old hardware and treating the economy as an ecosystem is highlighted. The comparison is made between ecosystems that have decomposing agents and our current economy, which lacks a similar component. However, some companies like Apple are beginning to address this issue by separating and decomposing the different parts of their products.  Apple is starting to break down phones and separate the different parts for recycling, with the ideal being able to produce new screens using old ones. There is a need for French law to pass a measure on repairability to move towards modular recycling. The current technology in semiconductors makes it difficult to recover silicon from chips, due to the high energy required to create silicon ingots.  I collect small chips and process them to extract valuable components while considering the issue of excessive optimization in our society. The semiconductor part is currently highly optimized but lacks a solution for managing energy discontinuity. Just-in-time systems that are overly optimized can easily break down when faced with interruptions, leading to lengthy rebuilding processes.  it will take a significant amount of time and effort to rebuild and fix all the broken systems. The lack of readiness in technology, like VR, is evidence of the ongoing technological transition. The Apple "Vision Pro" glasses, with their high price, unconventional design, and external battery, are not yet fully developed and ready for the market.  The integration of the internet into people's lives is not yet fully realized, leading to a societal focus on indulgence rather than productivity. This behavior grants significant power to certain individuals or entities, potentially compromising future technological advancements. The example of Google's ChatGPT development illustrates the possibility of other actors surpassing and outmaneuvering big players when the time comes for technological readiness.  The development of new technologies can disrupt established players if they are not prepared to handle them. Market readiness is crucial for the success of innovative products, as even advanced technology may be useless without a suitable market. While companies like OpenAI have made significant advancements, there is still something missing for their technologies to fully function. It is possible that a small startup or a major player like Apple or DeepMind could introduce a groundbreaking solution that revolutionizes the industry. Additionally, the future may witness a shift where LLMs become more compact, affordable, and accessible, potentially changing the way people interact with them on a daily basis. Combining technologies like a voice interface and an unidentified third element could further enhance their capabilities.  idea that there is a missing element in the integration of voice interfaces with devices like Google Nest and Siri. The speaker highlights the lack of smooth transition between devices and the difficulty in implementing it effectively. They mention the example of the Uber app, which has grown significantly in terms of lines of code, but the overall concept remains the same.  The latest version of code lines for Uber had over 10 million, with many corner cases added to improve its functionality. Managing the transfer of information between different devices is not as easy as it seems, especially when considering layout changes from mobile phones to PCs. The brain processes information differently depending on the mode and distance, which requires focused research to understand how to effectively manage information in different modes.  Research is important, even if it involves making multiple prototypes. The current startup and big company environment lacks the ability to stay focused on the end goal. Collaboration and using tools like Collab and Drive can help streamline workflows and promote experimentation.  - Future planning is a crucial aspect of success as it allows individuals and organizations to set goals and work towards them.
- The process of future planning involves identifying objectives, considering potential obstacles, and creating strategies to overcome them.
- Successful future planning requires a balance between being proactive and adapting to unexpected circumstances to ensure long-term achievements.</p>
