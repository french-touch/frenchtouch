[FrenchTouch.tech](http://www.frenchtouch.tech) is about discussing the specifics of the `french-touch`. 

This blog started after reading multiple news article which mentionned the `french-touch` but never explained what it was referrring to...

It is also about discussing how the french culture and ways of doing things can bring a much needed diversity in a world falling at lighting speed under the influence of english speaking media and artists.

Obviously, other old world reaching cultures like [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_China), [Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire),[Nigeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nok_culture), ... or new upcoming ones like [Brazil](http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0034-73292010000300002&script=sci_arttext) could also bring another point of view but we will leave this to people knowing those culture well enough to talk about them.
