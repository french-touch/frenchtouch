We are lacking an healthy ground for research for novel solutions

On one side, we have created a research environment where radical ideas can not flourish. On the other hand, we have been sold the idea that adult people can not cope with uncertainty and need defined solutions with no experimentation. This contrast is creating an environment where novel solutions are not being communicated nor developed and people are losing time with existing solutions. In a time where we are dealing with new types of crisis, this is becoming a problem. 

There are obscure knowledge pockets and it is difficult to get information on those. For example, we know the ingredients of tooth paste but we do not know why we chose those ingredients. Also 

We say that universities have become like the church, we have a dogma imposed this time not by God but by experts who are regarded as experts by their peers. They run entire research facilities and their word decides the publicability of an idea. They can reject ideas without 

At the same time, people are expected to have a solution beforehand. Therefore

People have lost truth in experts

Universities impose a knowledge dogma
