VR and AR will introduce new input devices

If we look at the counter website we can see that 57% of the traffic comes on mobile, 40% from desktop and 3% comes from tablet. And with the recent announcement of the metaverse by Facebook/Meta, we can wonder what would be the evolution of those devices.

It seems mobile devices will be replaced by augmented reality and desktop will be replaced by virtual reality. And this is not surprising because at the end of the day, many people see these innovations just as a new type of "screens". For example with VR, we just extend to the maximum the surface that is available to display information. AR removes the need to have a mobile device with screen on your pocket as the glasses will replace the 7 inch screen of your mobile. You will just need to have a computing device with you or in the cloud.
Talking about compute power the release of the steam deck has shown that people now have a need to have 3D rendering capabilities in or make a portable format. The iPhone 13 chip is powered by a desktop custom chip. 
What we can do it we can separate the computing power from the screen. 

Today the screen is the guy in augmented reality and what will happen is that at the computer Depot it will be separated from the screen and the screen will be on your face competing power can become a new input device for instance it could be controller we could be a keyboard or it could be appointing device.

Because I think this is where the really no way she's going to take place not in the VR/AR introduction which is just a new type of screen but in the new controllers that are going to be fostered by this new opportunity meeting that now the screen is out of the way we need to find a way to get people's input.

We will not need any more to have did he get it screen and possible of the tablet but we do need to have a pointing device where we can write on and that's what way we're going to keep on needing a tablet.
