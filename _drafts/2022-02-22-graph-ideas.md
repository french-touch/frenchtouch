markdown plugin which allows to link ideas from other sources in context

graph of ideas is linear in sequence and graph when multiple sources are then merged

science is the fact that 2 people have reviewed ideas and validated

challenge is legacy of latex for scientific creation (HTML more powerful for rendering but much harder for creation)
