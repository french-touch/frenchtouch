[FrenchTouch.dev](http://frenchtouch.dev) is about discussing the specifics of the `french-touch`. 

This blog started after reading multiple news article which mentionned the `french-touch` but never explained what it was referrring to...

It is also about discussing how the french culture and ways of doing things can bring a much needed diversity in a world falling at lighting speed under the influence of english speaking media and artists.

As it can be seen in Eric Meyer's book, or from the online diagrams available from the [web site](https://erinmeyer.com/tools/culture-map-premium/) the french tend to gravitate near the center of the diagram (except on the confrontations :) ). 

We believe bringing this nuance look to tech, can add a new dimension to discussions about tech and starting this blog.
