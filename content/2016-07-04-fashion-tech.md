# Fashion, Technology and Trends

It's easy to gather on the internet articles which summarize the evolution of clothes. For instance, Buzzfeed has created some viral videos regarding the evolution of clothing in the western world.

Another completely unrelated field in the technology world. This field features the appearance of gadgets and software products whose existence is made possible thanks to the latest advancements in technology and linked to the time those breakthrough appeared.

Both worlds are based on trends and feature important actors that have changed everything (Fashion by Coco Chanel for example and Technology by Steve Jobs). Those figures are extremely public and are representative of the breakthrough of the time they lived in.

And more importantly, both fields are marked by followers. Trends are made to be followed, copied, venerated ... So it is worth to ask ourselves the question: why people do follow trends instead of deciding by themselves.

It seems people have a limited amount of decisions per day. This phenomenon is called Decision Fatigue. This explains why people would delegate certain decisions to external parties like recognized elites or public figures. This delegation process requires trust and the trust is usually reached through social agreement.

Another example is in Quantum physics where the Copenhagen Interpretation. This interpretation comes from Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg and they are regarded as the main experts in this field. It is the most commonly taught quantum physics interpretation but as the wikipedia article shows, it is not the only one ...
