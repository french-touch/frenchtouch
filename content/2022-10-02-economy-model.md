# Economic models

## classics

GDP is a funciton of labor and cash

## Physics based

Economy output is a function of:

* energy
* ressources
* space
* time
* programmable agent
* recipes (how to manufacture and product market fit)

### Examples: Farming

* industrial agriculture has best yield per farmers
* permaculture and traditional farming has better yields per m2 than industrial farming
* industrial farming has worst output when focusing on yields per invested calories: it spends ten to twelve calories energy to produce a calorie.
