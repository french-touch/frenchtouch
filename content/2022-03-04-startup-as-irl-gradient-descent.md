# Business Development is a Gradient descent algorithm

## Startups

Startup creators often explain their journey with desert crossing and multiple lucky events.

Goal is to find an unknown oasis or to discover an existing oasis where you are bringing new value

## Gradient descent 

* Initial condition
* Step size
* Inertia

## How it works together 

risk is that starting too far from oasis

problem is gradient descent on complex system with feedback on your movement and local efficiency


## Serial Entrepreneur

Capable to optimise the gradient descent in a more effective way to get away from minimum local or maximum local 

some times need to pivot and add a new dimension which was not taken into accoutn before

Pivoting is the ability to handle inertia to identify a new trajectory with steeper gradient to a new optimum
