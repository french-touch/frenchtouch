## Problems in sources of information

> Society advances when information goes faster from brain to brain.

Those are the identified problems with the information we currently consume:

- No source of information is given
- Facebook Google and other companies are keeping us in information bubbles
- There are better features in some channels for example Google News understands better than Google search
- Recommenders are opaque systems
  - First, corporations do not want to divulge how they recommend. 
  - Secondly machine learning models are difficult to understand because you human categories are not the same as machine categories and we do not have words to describe them.

- There's a lot of noise and quantity. 
  - There's a lot of so-called influencers or expert just throwing information. 
  - Quantity is more important than quality and becomes the sole KPI to maximize.
