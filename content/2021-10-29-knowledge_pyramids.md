## DIKW 

```pyramid
Wisdom
Knowledge
Information
Data
```

* Wisdom is often described as the "Why", "Goals to aspire to"
* Knowledge being the supporting layer for wisdom but also the ability to put information into context
* Information being the next layer down and so on...

### Evidence based pyramid 

### medical

The below is a simplified wording for the pyramid suggested by Guyatt and Sackett in 1995 [1]

```pyramid
Meta-analyses
RCTs with definitive results 
RCTs with non-definitive results 
Cohort studies
Case Studies
Surveys
Case reports
```

### others

```pyramid
filtered information
un-filtered information
background information
```

```pyramid
...
RCT
cohort studies
case studies
folk information vs expert opinion
```


## Collect Visualize Model and Optimise (CVMO) pyramid

this article proposes a unified way to interlink data, information, knowledge, wisdom and evidence.

The change of paradigm being instead of focusing on the desired results (stronger evidence, data or information, ...) to focus on the actual steps required to get there.

The pyramid becoming:

``` pyramid
Optimise
Model
Visualize
Collect
```

* Collect data: this can be either finding existing data sets or establishing new methods for collecting data.
* Visualise data: this is the art or science known as data vizualisation (aka `data-viz`)
* Model data: how the different variables (or dimensions) of data are related to each other. 
    * Once a model is established it can be used to make predictions and also run multiple scenarii.
    * this is often in the field of science (pure or apply) or engineering
* Optimise has actually two dimensions:
    * optimising actions towards a dedicated outcome (known as wisdom in the `DIKW pyramid`)
    * optimising of the model either to simplif it (`accam's rasor`) or optimising the model to reduce the gap between the model predictions and observed changes in data when actions are undertaken.
